This website demostrated more or less an overall overview for what exactly a heatmap
is for how we may apply our function to a map. A particular part of this article that 
we may be able to implement revolves around different maps to tracker user activity on
the website itself. We may be able to apply user pinned posts on a map and utilize
this overly to replicate some sort of heat map (with a map filled with pins for posts
as the main, this heat map more like a visual data represention filter rather then the
main thing).

This website is sort of the holy bible of a google function that we would hopefully be 
able to replicate and deploy on google maps. If we want to develope our heat map using
google maps, this is the way we can do it. I was thinking a similar application to how
snapmaps works, with similar pins in addition to heat map areas of interest that would
link to a linked list of user posts ordered from most to least popular.

This may be more of a abstract deployment of a heat map, maybe more as an alternate 
way to view specific areas. I would save this in the backpocket as an additional feature
for brownie points.

This website also displays a world-wide heat map implimentation. We may want to look at
this since you can zoom in and out, although coverage may be too wide to be reliable. 
Shrinking the scale to maybe just the U.S would work the best for us in this scope.
