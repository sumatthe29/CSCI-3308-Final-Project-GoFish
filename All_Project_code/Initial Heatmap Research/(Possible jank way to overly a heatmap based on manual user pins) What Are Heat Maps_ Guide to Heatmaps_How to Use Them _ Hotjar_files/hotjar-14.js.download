I would like to collect all responses by Weds, 29 Apr 2020, so that we can start to make changes quickly.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I can't promise the Product updates will mirror exactly what you suggest, but your input will certainly help us produce a more useful and digestible flow of information.\n\nThanks again for sharing your feedback
